			<p class=head>This is DICE<p>
				<p>
					The video game industry is ever changing and evolving, which is one of its most interesting aspects. However, in order to always be the best at what we do, we constantly have to adapt to these changes.
					All of us here at DICE share the passion to create extraordinary things, which is something which has held true ever since four friends in the Amiga demo scene founded the company (then Digital Illusions) in 1992 and released cult hit Pinball Dreams for the Amiga. The early successes culminated ten years later when the groundbreaking Battlefield 1942 changed the future of both online gaming and DICE forever.
					<br />
					<br />
					Now, more than 20 years later, the name DICE has become synonymous with the highest pedigree of games, spearheaded by the ever-successful Battlefield series and the upcoming Mirror’s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront.
				</p>
			<p class=head>This is creativity</p>
				<p>
					For us, creativity is something that permeates our everyday life, in the office and outside of it. This is reflected in everything we do. Work for us isn’t something done by individuals, but rather a team effort where every member contributes with his or her own expertise.
					<br />
					<br />
					By exercising a flat hierarchy and nurturing an attentive design process, we give each and every employee the opportunity to contribute with their own ideas, how far-stretched or crazy they may seem at first. Not only does this keep our creativity high, it also helps build a climate that offers the best possible place for our staff to grow professionally, find new friends, and kick back after a hard day’s work.
				</p>
			<p class=head>This is world-class</p>
				<p>
					We regularly take stock of what we’ve done. We analyze previous work-routines and are always looking for new ideas that can be beneficial for everyone involved – not just our company but the video industry as a whole. The gaming sector may still be young, but that just means that we still can influence it. Being the world’s premiere game development studio, we’ve always felt obliged to strive for the very best. And with more than 20 years of experience, we are well aware of the fact that you never can rest on your laurels if you want to achieve greatness.
					<br />
					<br />
					Join us, and together we’ll create world-class games.
